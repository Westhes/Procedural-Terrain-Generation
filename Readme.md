# Procedural Terrain generation
My second attempt at creating a procedural mesh for a course.\
This time striving for a slightly more complicated mesh, in the form of a terrain.\
This brough unique challenges to the table, such as fitting chunks, being aware of your neighboring cells to know when a face can be omitted, and more.
